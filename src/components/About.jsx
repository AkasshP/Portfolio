      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a full‑stack engineer and MSIS candidate at Northeastern University with 3.5 years at Cognizant. I architect and implement end‑to‑end solutions—from designing scalable Node.js/Express back‑ends and MongoDB databases to building responsive React front‑ends. I excel at problem solving and performance tuning, and I’ve engineered ML pipelines and AI models using FastAPI, TensorFlow, and cutting‑edge GenAI frameworks. Whether it’s cloud deployments on AWS/Azure or translating complex requirements into accessible UIs, I deliver innovative, reliable products that empower users globally.
